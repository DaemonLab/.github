### About
Hello Developers :wave: 

Welcome to the home page of **Daemon Labs**, an open-source organization, managed by the programming club at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore. 
This organization maintains several useful code repositories. Some contain complete or nearly complete code files, while others are still in their development phase.
Most of these repositories are independent of each other, and the problems addressed by these are also unrelated.
### Aim
We aim to make open-source methodologies an integral part of our project development process. Unlike other organizations, we intend to keep our code public from the very beginning.
We encourage new developers to contribute in whatever manner they find suitable. Make sure to follow our contributing guidelines and code of conduct - it makes things easier for everyone!
